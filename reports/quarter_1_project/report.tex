\subsection{Background Information}
\subsection{Literature Review and Discussion of Prior Work}
\subsection{Description of Relevant Data}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis and Bias Checking}
\subsection{Cleaning Memo}
Here is how we cleaned the memo and various considerations.
\subsection{Categorization Approaches}
These are the various methods we tried.

\section{Results}
\subsection{tfidf+svm}
Confusion matrix and accuracy of each method. Testing conditions and environments. Inference and training times.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Summary of Methods}
Table summarizing all factors in choosing the best method.

Table \ref{tab:sometab1} presents some summary of the data.

\subsection{}
This is the best model overall
but these are also useful in these constraints.
